# LaTeX template for LING2350 (Linguistic Analysis)
Implementing as many elements of the stylesheet as possible.

## Using This Template
Here's some (hopefully comprehensive, eventually) instructions on how to use this template.
### Never used LaTeX?
I recommend making an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), which lets you write and preview LaTeX pretty easily. In the instructions below, I'll try to cover everything you need to know about LaTeX, so no need to do extra reading. Since the Ling Analysis papers probably won't use math equations or anything like that, and the template deals with formatting for you, the learning curve won't be terribly steep.
### Instructions
1. Download the template. If you're familiar with git, make a local copy of this repo so you can always pull the most up-to-date version. If those words mean nothing to you, just go to the [.tex file](https://github.com/trholdridge/ling-style-template/blob/main/ling_analysis_template.tex). From there, you can either:
    * right-click "Raw" in the top right and "Save link as..." whatever you want the file to be called. Then upload that file on Overleaf. Or...
    * just copy-paste the text into a blank Overleaf file (but the formatting might get a bit messy? I haven't actually tried it).
2. Understand where to write in the template. There's lots of fancy formatting, but if you can find the line `\begin{document}` you're set! Everything you write should go between that and the `\end{document}` line.
3. Learn the commands! Which is easier said than done, but not a terrible process. Everything you need to know is in the [demo PDF](https://github.com/trholdridge/ling-style-template/blob/main/ling_analysis_demo.pdf). (It's not complete yet, but should be within the next couple weeks.)
